# Steps Component

In This project we will explore One Of the most important React Concepts
Which are props and state.

## ðŸ‘‰ What is State?

Most Of the time a component needs to hold its own data over time
What if we want to make our app **interactive** by changing the result of
its ui as result of an **action** that's where state come into play.

State is basically data that a component can hold over time.
It is the information that it needs to remember through out
its life cycle.

We can think of the state as the **memory of a component**
User Can **change the state** and see the **view change** accordingly.

**_State Allow Developers_**:

1.  Update The Component View(Re-rendering it)
2.  Perist Local Variable between renders
